        "The main idea of this app, is that instead of searching for a specific movie by title, you can get three best ranking movies by year and genre. You can enter them manualy or get randomized results if you're feeling lucky. You can also save movies, mark them as watched and rate them later.",
        "This is by far the favorite project I made, simply because I like to use it very often. I see it is a great way to find a lot of movies you didn't know existed and it makes choosing movie much easier, by limiting the options to only three movies.",
        "I designed this website back in autumn 2022 and first made it in Vanilla JS, later I re-made it in React. The API I used is TMDB https://www.themoviedb.org."
