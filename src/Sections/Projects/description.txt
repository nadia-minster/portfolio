1. Movie - 

["The main idea of this app, is that instead of searching for a specific movie
by title, you can get three best ranking movies by year and genre. You can enter 
them manualy or get randomized results if you're feeling lucky. You can also save movies,
mark them as watched and rate them later.",

"This is by far the favorite project I made, simply because I like to use it very often. I see it is 
a great way to find a lot of movies you didn't know existed and it makes choosing 
a movie much easier, by limiting the options to only three movies.",

"I designed this website back in autumn 2022 and first made it in Vanilla JS, later I re-made it in React. 
The API I used is TMDB https://www.themoviedb.org."]

2.Recipe -
["This is a full-stack MERN application, where users can search for recipes and filter them by
meal type or cuisine, also save the recipes to cook them later. There's an option to create an account, 
or log in to existing one. All the passwords are securely hashed and salted, however all the 
functionality is still available to unauthenticated users.",
"I also implemented role-based access conrol to ensure that only the admin can create and edit new recipes. I finished working on this application in late May 2023."]
